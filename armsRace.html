            <p>The arms race during the Cold War was a close competition between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for military power.. It first began in at the end of the Second World War when the United States dropped the first two atomic bombs, “Little Boy” on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and “Fat Man” on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. After these bombs dropped, the USSR were determined to make their own atomic bombs in order to compete with the US. The first Soviet nuclear weapon was developed in 1949, which led to both the US and USSR to continue to race to make bigger and bigger nukes. The next step came in 1952 when the US tested the first Hydrogen bomb, which had a destructive power 2500 times that of the atomic bombs that they had previously used. This led the Soviet Union to make their own Hydrogen bomb shortly after in 1953. Although the two superpowers developed all of these powerful weapons, they did not intend to use them right away. They used the idea of nuclear deterrence, which stated that the countries with nuclear weapons would not be threatened by countries in order to prevent the provocation of a nuclear attack. Since both sides of the war believed in this, they needed more power in order to retaliate against any nuclear attacks against them. If a nuclear war were to break out between the two superpowers, it would mean an end to all life on Earth as we know because of the sheer destructive powers of the weapons being developed. This is reflected in the theory of Mutually Assured Destruction. Despite this, the USSR and US continued to develop weapons such as ICBMs, Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, in 1957 and 1958 which would allow nuclear warheads to be launched on a target from thousands of miles away. In 1959, the US was able to launch nuclear missiles close to the shore of the USSR using Polaris submarines deployed in the Pacific Ocean. At the height of the Cold War and arms race, the world stood at the brink of all out nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On October 14, 1962, a US U-2 spy plane flew over a communist Cuba run by Fidel Castro and photographed a Soviet ballistic missile being installed. Two days later on October 16, 1962, President John F Kennedy was briefed on the situation, and for the next thirteen days, the United States and Soviet Union intensely negotiated in order to prevent any warheads from being launched and consequently ending all life on Earth. They eventually came to the agreement that the Soviet Union would remove all nuclear weapons from Cuba, and the United States agreed not to invade Cuba. The US also secretly agreed to remove all missiles from Turkey, a country that neighbored the Soviet Union. This was the closest the world has ever been to pressing the big red button to cause mass destruction. Despite coming this close, the two countries continued to compete for nuclear superiority. In 1968, the Soviet Union gained the ability to shoot down US missiles launched on them by using an Anti-Ballistic Missile System. Also in 1968, the US developed MIRV technology which allowed them to use one missile to hit multiple targets at once. The arms race did not end until the end of the Cold War in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
